# AM05 -- requires inner join and left outer join instead of just join and left join. Excluding because it's more verbose.
# ST05 -- requires all sub-queries to be converted to CTEs. For some of the more complex queries with multiple nested
#       sub-queries, sqlfluff is possible altering the script logic when auto-fixing this issue. Re-enable this rule after
#       DS-160 is complete (i.e., sub-queries are manually re-written as CTEs).
# ST06 -- sqlfluff fix with this enabled can change the order of columns, which can break scripts with a UNION statement.
#       Should never be enabled!
